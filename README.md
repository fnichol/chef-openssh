# This Isn't The Canonical OpenSSH Chef Cookbook!

Hey there! The canonical source for the OpenSSH Chef cookbook is maintained by [Chef Software Inc.](https://chef.io) here:

* Source code: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/openssh
* Supermarket: https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/openssh

The master branch has been left intact for the time being, but it is highly recommended to no longer link against this repository in the future.

Please direct any development, issues, and pull requests at the above GitHub repository. Thanks!
